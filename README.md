This app allows to list rooms availability for the current term with multiple filtering options (Building, floor, week day, period...).
Rooms which aren't available all the day aren't displayed.

Data synchronization is first initiated by user and is then performed weekly in background.

WhereWork has been developed by a 6 students team during the laboratory periods in the LOG515 - Project management in software engineering class.
